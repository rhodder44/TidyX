ATOMIC HABITS
Laws of Positive Behaviour Change (or negative)
1. Make it obvious		 (make it invisible)              
2. Make it attractive 	 (unattractive)            
3. Make it easy		 (hard)      
4. Make it satisfying	 (unsatisfying)                             

Habit Building Process (Cue, Craving, Response and Reward)
1. Cue: 		triggers brain to initiate a behaviour
2. Cravings:	motivational force behind every habit
3. Response:	the actual habit you perform, can be an action or a thought
4. Reward:	end goal of every habit

Key Points
- Most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but who you wish to become
- Clinging to an identity makes it harder to grow beyond it
1. Avoid making any one part of identity an overwhelming part of who you are
2. Keep your identity small
* The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life changes you

Problems with GOALS
1. Winners and Losers both have goals
a. Goals are dictated by survivorship bias: where we concentrate only on the people who win (survivors) and believe their goals led to their success 
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
a. Achieve a goal only changes your life for the moment
b. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves
3. Goals restrict your happiness
a. Causes an “either/or” problem: you either achieve your goal and are happy or fail and are not happy
b. Makes you not happy during process, only when you achieve the goals
4. Goals are at odds with long term process
a. Purpose of setting goals is to win the game
b. Purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game





CUECRAVINGRESPONSEREWARDSee 7/11 as drive homeBegin to crave cookiesBuy cookies and eat themSatisfy craving through eating the cookies.

Buying cookies becomes associated with driving home from workHit a stumbling block on Uni projectFeel stuck and want to relieve frustrationPull out phone and check social mediaSatisfy craving to feel relieved.

Checking social media becomes associated with feeling stalled at work.Chapter 1: The surprising power of atomic habits
- Habits required patient and persistence
- Forget about Goals, Focus on Systems
- Atomic Habits = a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth

Chapter 2: How your habits shape you identify
- Beliefs drive actions
- Behaviour Change = Outcomes, Processes, Identify
- Behaviour that is dissimilar with the self will not last 
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identify
- Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action

Chapter 3: How to build better habits in 4 simple steps
- A habit is a behaviour that is repeated enough times to become automatic
- Only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity
- Ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible

Chapter 4: The man who didn’t look right
- You don’t need to be aware of a cue for a habit to begin
- The more automatic a habit becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it
- The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them


Chapter 5: The best way to start a new habit
- Implementation Intention
1. A plan you right out to specify when and where to act
2. Can use this both for habits and daily TO DO
3. Format is: “When situation X arise, I will perform response Y”
4. Shown in many studies to help stick to goals
- Habit Stacking
1. After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [NEW HABIT]
2. Key is pairing your desired behaviour into something you already do each day
3. Is a form of Implementation Intention
4. Works best when cue is highly specific and immediately actionable
* Many people’s cues are too vague

Chapter 6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- People often choose products not because of what they are but where they are
1. (don’t drive down FERRIS Street will mean no Cookies)
- If there are cookies on the bench, I will eat them
- Many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purpose, direction or choice, but by the most obvious option
- Vision is our largest sensor
1. As such: a small change in what you can see, can lead to a big change in what you do
2. Thereby, it is crucial to work and live in environments that are filled with productive cues and void of unproductive ones. 
- 
Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- “Disciplined” people are not better at self-control. Instead, they are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic will power and self-control.
1. They spend less time in tempting situations
- To improve Self-Control: need to create a more disciplined environment
- Bad habits are vicious loop. 
1. You feel bad, so you eat junk food, junk food makes you feel bad
- You can break a habit, but you are unlikely to forget it
1. Meaning, simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy

Chapter 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible
- Supernormal Stimuli = exaggerated version of reality
- Primary role of food science is to create products more attractive to customers
1. Every bag, box, jar has been enhanced in some way
- Dynamic Contrast: keeps the stimulus novel
1. Eating Kale gets boring
2. Eating doughnuts excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more
- The food industry used the 2nd Law of Behaviour Change: MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE
1. The more attractive an opportunity the more likely it is to become habit-forming
- Habits are a dopamine feedback loop
- KEY POINT: dopamine is not only released when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.
1. Whenever you anticipate an opportunity to be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation
2. And so, does your level of motivation to act
3. It is the anticipation of reward that gets us to act, not the fulfilment.

Chapter 9: The role of Family and Friends in Shaping your Habits
- What ever habits are normal in your culture are the most attractive to behaviours
- Your social norms are the invisible rules that govern your behaviour
- Behaviours are attractive when they help us fit in
- Imitate three main groups
1. The close 
2. The many
3. The powerful
- The Close: 
1. The closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate their behaviours
- The Many:
1. Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group for guidance
* We check google, for the best buying, eating, fitness behaviours
2. There can be a downside:
* The internal pressure to comply with the group
* The reward of being accepted, is greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart or finding the truth
3. Most days we would rather be wrong with the crowd, than right by ourselves.
4. When changing habits that are against the group norm, the habits become unattractive
- The Powerful:
1. We imitate the people we envy

Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of your Bad Habits
- A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive
1. Gain prestige = play video game
2. Gain social acceptance = post on Instagram
3. Reduce uncertainty = search on Google
- Your current habits are not necessarily the best solution for a problem, they are just the methods you learned to use
- Every action during the day is predicative
1. See a hot plate, if I touch it, I will burn myself
2. The lights turned green, if I Accelerate, I will get through safety and reach my destination quicker
- We are endlessly predicating the next moment
- The cause of your habits is the prediction that precedes them
- Desire is the difference between where you are now, and where you want to be in the future
1. If you are cold: but want to be warm
- The specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives
1. When a habit successful fulfils a motive, you create a craving to do it again
* We learn that watch YouTube helps us avoid our fears
* Or Facebook helps us feel loved
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this to our advantage

Chapter 11: How to walk Slowly but never Backwards
- Quantity wins over quality in the long run, as you learn from your mistakes and hone your performance
1. We are always focused on find the best approach, that we never end up taking action
- Difference between being in motion and action
1. Motion = planning and strategizing (doesn’t produce result)
2. Action = type of behaviour that produces an outcome
- We get stuck in motion, as it makes us feel like we are making progress, without running the risk of failure
- Motion makes you feel like you are getting something done, instead you are just planning on getting something done
- Habit formation is the process whereby a habit becomes progressively more automatic
1. When trying to learn a new language, movement or skill, great difficulty is felt
2. As the channels which each sensation must pass have not been established
3. Through repetition this difficulty vanishes
4. The actions become automatic, to the point that they can be performed whole the mind is otherwise engaged
- Habit formation isn’t dictated by time, instead number of repetitions
1. Doesn’t matter if you 30 days or 300 days have passed
2. What does matter is at what rate you perform the behaviour
3. Need to string together enough successful attempts that it becomes embedded in your mind.

Chapter 12: The Law of Least Effort
- Europe and Asia agriculture grew at a faster rate than the Americas, as it was in the same climate range (horizontal) vs different climate zones (vertical)
1. The changes started out small – a crop that spread slightly farther.
2. A population grew slightly faster
3. But compounded into substantial differences over time
- Humans real motivation = being lazy and doing what is convenient
1. This is actually smart
2. Energy is precious, the brain is wired to conserve whenever possible
- Crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it
- Rather than try overcoming friction in your life, try reducing it
- Best way to reduce friction = practice environmental design
1. More likely to go to the gym if it is on the way home from work

Chapter 13: How to stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
- Researches believe 30-40% of our actions are done out of habit each day
- A habit must be established before it can be improved
- Once your first two minutes of a habit become easy, it then allows you to slip into a state of deep focus
- Secret to a habit remaining is keeping it below the point where it feels like work
1. Always stop when you are going good

Chapter 14:  How to make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- Best way to break a bad habit is to increase the friction, make it impossible to do
1. How can I make 7/11 stops impossible?
* Find a route that doesn’t have any?

Chapter 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change
- What is rewarded is repeated
- What is punished is avoided
- We need to get immediate satisfaction as a reward
- Cost of your good habits are in the present
- Cost of your bad ones are in the future
- Add a little bit of satisfaction/pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long run
- We remember the end of our experience the most, need it to be satisfying
- AGAINST BAD HABITS
1. Make a loyalty program for yourself
2. When I skip 7-11 put $2.5 across to an account 
* Have something I want to buy as the target
- Immediate feedback helps maintain motivation until long term rewards arrive

Chapter 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- Visual measurement/feedback provides Immediate satisfaction
- Tracking goals = more likely to succeed
- Habit Tracker
1. Recording your last action, creates a trigger that can initiate the next one
2. Keeps us honest, we have a distorted view of our own behaviours
* And think we act better than we do
3. Helps on bad days where we can forgot all the good work we have achieved
4. Manually tracking should be kept for only your most important habits
* Track 1-2 habits very well
* Instead of 10 habits poorly
5. Record the habit immediately after completing it

Chapter 17: How an Accountability Partner can Change Everything
- Just like we would be more likely to finish something that is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid something that is painful
- When consequences are severe people learn quickly
1. Surgeon needs to avoid cutting a blood vessel = becomes good quickly 

Chapter 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)
- To increase your odds of success = choose the right competition
- Habits are more enjoyable and likely to succeed when they align with your tendencies and inclinations

Chapter 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work 
- To maintain motivation and interest : work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty”
- The brain loves a challenge, but only when it is within an optimal zone of difficulty
1. Tennis vs Federer vs Baby vs Equal
2. Federer to hard, Baby to easy, Equal provides a challenge
- Goldilocks Rule: humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are at the edge of their current capabilities. Not to easy, not hard, just right.
- If you hit the Goldilocks zone, you can enter a “Flow State”
- Flow State: the experience of being in the zone, where you are fully immersed 
- To enter this the task must be 4% beyond your current ability
- Mastery requires practice
1. The more you practice something, the more boring the routine becomes

Chapter 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
- When things feel like they are mastered, and you slip are comfortable: must avoid slipping into complacency.
1. Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for an entiprise
2. The way to be successful is to learn to do things right, and then repeat them
3. This requires REFLECTION
- Reflection and review:
1. Enables long term improvement
2. Highlight your mistakes
3. Help consider other possible paths for improvement
4. Without reflection: can make excuses and rationalization or lie to ourselves
* We don’t have any process to compare if we are doing better or worse than yesterday
Conclusion
- Holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement, it’s a thousand of them stacking up
- Success is not a goal to reach – it is a system to improve, an endless process to refine

Appendix
- Happiness is not the achievement of pleasure, it is when you finally arrive at a place where you do not want to change
- Appealing to emotion is better than appealing to reason, as people process the same information different through their emotional filter
- Your actions reveal your true motivations
- The reward only comes after the energy is spent
- Expectations change satisfaction
1. Expect $10 and get $50 – feel great
2. Expect $100 and get $50 – fell bad



DEEP WORK
GO SOMEWHERE
- Potentially downstairs study
1. Make it feel important instead of a chore
2. Make and end time so its not an open ended slog
ROUTINE
- Put phone in cupboard or draw
- Chunk at beginning what you are going to do
1.  (so you don’t have to keep reminding)
- Organize anything else you need to complete the task
- Lock off any other distractions 
1. Tabs on  computer
2. Other  papers
3. Phone

NO INTERNET
- Allocate blocks of internet/no internet time
1. Find what works for me
2. 30mins – no internet
3. 20 min - internet
- If I’m offline and need the internet
1.  Move to another task till the time is up

SHUTDOWN ROUTINE
- Needed so for closure on the task
- Note down anything left remaining
- Have a plan in plan in place to complete it 
- Then shut down for that task

PRODUCTIVE THOUGHTS
- LOOPING
1. Stop yourself looping over the same thought
2. Identify when you loop and what is making you loop
3. Move past loop and think about the bigger thought and create a goal



Noise and The Signal: Why so many predictions fail

KEY IDEAS
Predictions
- We overrate our ability to predict the world around us
- Prediction Failures
o We focus on the story that we want them to tell, not how it really is
o We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose the greatest threats
o When someone states their innocence or ignorance, this is often the first line of defence when there is a failed forecast
o Don’t mistake confidence in a prediction for accuracy
o Most failures of prediction stem from a false sense of confidence 
o Precise forecasts masquerade as accurate ones
- Evidence suggests that aggregate or group forecasts are more accurate than individual ones
- TIP
o When model shows an unexpected or hard to explain result. 
o Presume it is a bug in the model
- Seek out predictions that are based on probabilities or percentage, they are more true in nature
- If the prediction is not in probabilistic terms, the forecaster has probably:
o Not thought through the problem properly
o Overfit their model
o Are overconfident
o More interested in make a name for themselves
- Don’t dismiss “UNREALISTIC” could be that people don’t think it is possible and don’t consider it
o By asking what we don’t know, we may get a few more predictions right
o Helps to find out things other people are thinking about
Risk vs Uncertainty
- Risk: something you can put a price on
- Uncertainty: risk that is hard to measure
Positive vs Negative Feedback
- Positive Feedback: as prices go up, so do sales
- Negative Feedback: as prices go up, sales go down
o Example of supply and demand
Prediction vs Forecasting
- Prediction: is a definitive and specific statement about when and where an earthquake will strike.
o A major earthquake will hit Kyoto, Japan on June 28
- Forecast: is a probabilistic statement, usually over a longer time scale 
o There is a 60% chance of an earthquake in Southern California over the next thirty years
Self-Fulfilling vs Self-Cancelling Predictions
- Self-Fulfilling: The very act of prediction can alter the way that people behave, and affect the outcome of the prediction itself 
- Self-Cancelling: Where a prediction tends to undermine itself
o GPS in car sending everyone on the quickest route will quickly become the slowest route

Overfitting
- Act of mistaking noise for signal is overfitting
- Loose fit: means model is under fit and you will not be capturing as much of the signal as you could
- Overfit: model is to tight, you are fitting the noise instead of discovering its underlying structure 
o Most likely to occur when the data is limited, noisy and your understanding of the fundamental relationship is poor
o A forecaster should never ignore data. If they have little to begin with this is probably a sign they are overconfident and are overfitting their model
Ways of Thinking
- The instinctual shortcut that we take when we have “too much information” is to engage with it selectively, picking out the parts we like and ignoring the remainder, making allies with those who have the same choices and enemies of the rest
- Our minds are always looking for a signal, when sometimes we should be considering how noisy the data is
- Don’t be to stubborn to learn from mistakes
- Failing to change our forecast because we risk embarrassment by doing so – that reveals a lack of courage
- The word objective is sometimes taken to be synonymous with quantitative. But it isn’t.
o Instead it means seeing beyond our personal biases and prejudices and towards the true of the problem
- Good innovators think very big and very small
o New ideas are sometimes found in the most granular	 details of a problem where few others bother to look
- Rational Bias: the less reputation you have, the less you have to lose by taking a big risk when you make a prediction
- Recognizing that the amount of confidence someone confidence in a prediction is not a good indication of its accuracy – to the contrary, these qualities are often inversely correlated.
- Think of problems In life as probabilities instead of Yes / No


Poker
- Put players on a range (group of similar hands) of possible hands not just one hand
- To substantially mitigate your losses
o Fold your worst hands
o Bet your best hands
o Make some efforts to consider what your opponent has
- If you can’t spot one or two bad players, then you probably shouldn’t play 
o As you are likely the worst player

Investing
- Do the opposite of Fight or Flight
- When the market crashes = put money in, don’t get scared and pull out
- Don’t make initial investments when the market is overvalued
o Will struggle to make a positive return of any kind
- Avoid buy during a bubble
- Avoid selling during a panic

Brain can hold roughly 1TB of data
- However this is only one-millionth that IBM produces each day
- We need to be selective with the information we choose to remember
RANGE

APPLIED NOTES
Problem Solving
- Whenever you are stuck on a problem, think entirely outside of your domain
- Use analogies from other domains and experiences when facing a problem or task
- Remove one object, to get a different picture
Innovation
- Bring New Skills to and Old Problem – Or New problem to Old Skills
Career Matching Optimization
- Find experiments that can be undertaken quickly
- Test and Learn – Not Plan and Implement
Prediction
- Narrow experts are an invaluable resource
1. So take facts from them – not opinions (they have blinders on)
- Don’t draw conclusions form incomplete data
- Don’t rely on what is just in front of you
- When you don’t have any data, you have to use reason - Feynman

LATE SUCCESSFUL CAREERS (RANGE)
- Have range (8 lane highways vs 1 lane highway)
- Take knowledge from one domain and applying it creatively to another
- Used outside experiences to looks at problems from different perspectives
- More successful play writes had experience in writing Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Crime, Adult, Fiction and Comedy
- And were not overworked

OVERSPECIALIZATION (NARROW)
- Highly credentialed experts can become so narrow-minded that they actually get worse with experience, even while becoming more confident
- Narrow Specialists are still desired when you need someone were the goal is to re-create prior performance with as little deviation as possible
1. Brain surgeon, you want the same doctor and team who have done it many times
- More scientifically literature people are more likely to be dogmatic about politically polarizing topics science
1. As they are better at finding evidence which confirms their feelings

SAMPLING PERIOD
- Lightly structured
- Some lesion with a breadth of topics / activities
- Followed later by narrowing of focus, increased structure and practice volume
Example: Elite Athletes
- Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts
- Instead they undergo what researches call a “Sampling Period”
1. Playing a variety of sports
2. Usually unstructured or light structured environments
3. Gaining a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw
4. They learn about their own abilities 
- They later on them focus in and ramp up technical practice in the one area.
Parents with creative children made their opinions known after kids did something they didn’t like
- They just did not proscribe It beforehand
- Their households were low on prior restraints
Parents should have their kids participating in activities that:
- Develop their general athleticism
- Probe their talents and interests
- Before focusing narrowly on their skills
SWITCHING = WINNING
Individuals who reach the apex of their domain
- Quit fast and often when they detect that a plan is not the best fit
- Quitting takes a lot more guts than continuing to be carried along like debris
Example: Van Gogh and his match quality optimization
- He tested options with maniacal intensity and 
- Getting the most informational signal about his fit as quickly as possible
- Then he moved onto something else and repeated
- Until he had zigzagged his way to a place no one else had ever been
We are effected by the “sunk cost fallacy”
- Having invested time or money into something, we are loathed to leave it
- As that would suggest we had wasted out time or money
History Illusion
- We believe our desires and motivations will not change much in the future
- However as seniors, thinking about their teenagers selves and their changes (hair ect)
- We are works in progress
Progression at Different Rates
- Compare yourself to yourself yesterday -- not to younger people who aren’t you

THINK OUTSIDE OF DOMAIN / ABSTRACT THINKERS
- Have conceptual reasoning skills that can connect new ideas and work across contexts
- Relying on information/experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous
- If a problem was easily solved, people within the industry would have solved it
1. Domain based solutions are often inferior
- Knowledge is a double edged sword
1. It allows you to do some things
2. But makes you blind to other things that you could do
Outside View
- The most clever solutions always come from a piece of knowledge that was not a part of the normal curriculum
Inside View 
- The more internal details you have about a particular scenario, the more likely you are to say that the scenario you are investigating will occur
- Experts know the innate details about a topic, but do not know the adjacent stuff
- Focusing narrowly on many fine details specific to a problem at hands feels like exact right thing to do, when it is often exactly wrong
- Example: Netflix suggestion algorithm
1. Initially was very complex but not accurate, as it was trying to predict what you like
2. Then change to analogizing you to many other customers with similar viewing histories
Old Knowledge
- Innovation doesn’t just need to be at the  cutting forefront
- You can look back at old knowledge that was left behind
- And wield this old knowledge in a new ways
Functional Fixedness
- People have the tendency to only consider familiar used of objects

LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
Kind Learning Environments
- Patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid
- Golf - Chess
Wicked Learning Environments
- Rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed inaccurate or both.
- Firefighters in a new situation


LEARNING
Learning is best done slowly, to accumulate lasting knowledge
- This means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress
- The most effective learning looks inefficient
- It looks like you are falling behind
Most basic message:
- teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning
Fermi Learning
- Break down problem so I can leverage what little I know to start investigating what I don’t.
Bad Way of Teaching
- Providing rewards for repetitive short-term success with a narrow range of solutions
- As when rules are altered slightly, students are unable to have flexibility to adapt
Making Connections vs Using Procedures
- Teachers who provide hints to students instead of letting them grapple with some confusion teach the students to find patterns and procedures they can use to answer questions.
1. Without understanding how they can problem solve themselves
- Parents will also do the same with homework help
1. Parents will show children “faster and easier” ways of solving the problem
2. However this doesn’t teach children to make connections, instead just to use procedures
- Parents want kids to understand quickly and easily. This is WRONG
1. For learning that is durable and flexible, fast and easy is the problem
Blocked Practice
- Is practicing the same thing repeatedly
- Each problem employing the same procedure
- Leads to excellent immediate performance
Mixed/Interleaved Practice
- Learning under varied conditions
- Allows knowledge to be flexible
- Interleaving improves the ability to match the right strategy to a problem
Learning Slow & Long vs Fast & Easy
- Desirable difficulties
1. Obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term
2. But a lot better in the long term
3. Excessive hint giving does the opposite
4. Bolstering immediate performance but undermines progress in the long run
Learning by Being Wrong
- The more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information sticks when they subsequently learn the right answer
- Struggling to retrieve information primes the brain for subsequent learning, even when retrieval is unsuccessful
- Frustration is not a sign you are learning, but ease is


PREDICTION AND FORECASTING
- Narrow experts are an invaluable resource
- However they most likely have blinders on
- So take facts from them – not opinions
- Best forecasters have:
1. Open minds
2. Their ideas are hypotheses that need testing
3. Goal is not to show how smart or right they are
4. Instead to try falsify their own notions 
- Best scientists
1. Look at new evidence, whether or not it agrees with their current beliefs
- When facing a question or problem
1. It is better to consider completely unrelated events with structural commonalities 
2. Rather than relying on intuition based on personal experience or a single are of expertise
- Carter Racing Problem
1. Teaches students not to come to conclusions from incomplete data
2. Don’t just rely on what is in front of you
When you don’t have any data, you have to use reason - Feynman


  SUPER-FORCASTING: The art and science of prediction

Don’t believe specialists
Cochrane didn’t doubt the specialist and the specialist didn’t doubt his own judgement – so neither man thought the possibility that the prognoses was wrong
*Don’t believe everything “Specialists” or smart people say

Doubt
It was the absence of doubt, and scientific rigour that medicine was unscientific and caused it to stagnate for so long
*Doubt is required progress – without doubt we do not question anything as we believe we are 100% correct.

It’s a rare day when a journalist says “The market rose today for any of a hundred different reasons, or a mix of them. So who knows?”
*People will claim to know the answer to justify their position and opinion

Attribute Substitution (Bait and Switch)
When faced with a hard question, we often unconsciously replace it with an easy one. If the answer is “yes” to the easy question, it becomes a proxy answer for the original hard question
*Will Luke Shuey be tagged? (Hard question I cannot answer)
*Has Luke Shuey been tagged in the past? (Easy question, where the answer is yes)

Emotional bait and switch
Can’t answer a hard question so we answer instead: “How bad does this make me feel?”

We know we should slow down and think before drawing from conclusions.
*If I have time, stop and think
*Be prepared to accept that what seems obviously true now, may turn out to be false later



Forecasting is estimating the likelihood of something happening

Hedgehog’s view
View distorts their foresight
*more info doesn’t help because it is seen through the same lenses
*need to look from many perspectives, if solely focused on one, won’t see the other important info


Briar Score
*measures distance between what you predicted and what actually happened 
*lower is better
*0=perfect
*2= complete opposite of reality
*0.5= what you get by random guessing
*0.22= pretty impressive


Aggregation
Hundreds of people added valuable information to a collective pool, greater than any one of them possessed
*Aggregate data by combining multiple data sources together, errors will be cancelled out and positive info will help refine the model

Wisdom of the crowd
Get 100 people to forecast an event. See how they go and identify the best 40. Then have everyone make lots more forecasts, this time calculating the average forecast for the whole group (the wisdom of the crowd) – but with extra weight given to the 40 top forecasters. The give it one final tweak by extremizing the forecast closer to 100% or 0, by bumping up say 70% to 85% and 30% down to 15%.
*Have initial perspectives
*Find the best perspectives and weight them
*Extremise the model
*Aggregate all the perspectives and weight the ones you respect more

Illusion of control and prediction
single out an extraordinary successful person, that it was highly unlikely to do what he or she did, and conclude that luck could not be the explanation. Wall Street – where someone beast the market 6-7 years in a row. However they ignore how many other people are trying to do the same thing as them. For instance if someone wins the lottery we don’t say they are a great lottery picker because we know there are millions of tickets sold, which makes it highly likely somewhere, someone will win.
*Illusion of control/prediction: when we believe someone is a great forecaster due to their success, but don’t look at how many people are trying to do the same thing, in which it is mostly due to luck/randomness.


Correlation
*0.5= a strong but imperfect relationship
*If a father is 6 foot and the average is 5’8 foot, we would make a compromise prediction based of both.
*compromised prediction = 5’10 foot
How to interpret other correlation numbers:
1.0 = perfect, base the sons height of the fathers
0.0 = use the average giving no weight to the fathers height

Regression to the mean
*Tool to test the role of luck in a model
*This mistake is responsible for many other things people believe but shouldn’t
*Slow regression= in activities dominated by skill
*Fast regression- in activities associated with chance

Fermi 
Look at more options than just the first thing that comes to our head
*What information would allow me to answer the question?
*By breaking down the question we can better separate the “knowable” and “unknowable”
*Better result than the estimate we pulled out of the black box when we first read the question

Regression to the mean
*Tool to test the role of luck in a model
*This mistake is responsible for many other things people believe but shouldn’t
*Slow regression= in activities dominated by skill
*Fast regression- in activities associated with chance

*Can help avoid the “Bait and Switch” when we answer the initial question with an easier question
*Outside View= broader (eg: 62% of USA households own pets)
*Inside view= Specifics 

Anchoring
Number we start our model at

*A bad anchor can create a bad estimate
*Start with a meaningful anchor 
*Start with an anchor from the outside view

Research has found that using a second estimate from oneself improves the accuracy almost as much as asking for a second estimate from someone else
*Aggregate your first, second, third estimates for improved accuracy


Turn the question on its head
Reverse the question (Will L. Shuey be tagged vs will L. Shuey not be tagged)
*A good way of providing a different perspective on the question.

Uncertainty
Nothing is 100%
*Scientist accept uncertainty
*Because certainty is illusory
Uncertainty can cause people to prefer the certainty of a bad thing than the mere possibility of one


Why is a decline from 5% - 0 more valuable than a decline from 10% - 5%?
*Because it provides “certainty”
*0 and 100% weigh far more heavily in our minds that the mathematical models say they should

Epistemic uncertainty
Something you don’t know, but is knowable
*Mystery machine can be torn apart by engineers and understood

Aleatory uncertainty 
Something you don’t know and is unknowable
*Will it rain in a year in Boston


Granularity predicts accuracy
*Most people are not precise, they stick with the 3 point mental model (Yes, Maybe, No)
*That is a mistake

Basic Forecasting Model
1. Unpack the question into components
2. Distinguish between the known and unknown (as best as possible)
a. Leave no assumption unscrutinised
3. Outside view
a. Downplaying its uniqueness and treating it as part of a wider class
4. Inside view
a. Play up its uniqueness of the problem
5. Explore the similarities and differences of your views and others
6. Look at prediction markets and other methods of extracting wisdom from the crowds
7. Synthesis all the views into a single vision
8. Express your judgement as accurate as you can
a. Using a finely grained scale of probability
9. UPDATE – in light of changing infomation

Set alerts
Google alerts for “AFL” and “Injury”
Set this to report daily



Updating
Super-forecasters update regularly and frequently
When the facts change, they change their mind
Only minimal changes (to avoid over and under-reaction)
Example:
- Initial forecast = 60%
- New info comes out
- You think it is between 1-10%
- Nail down further for reasons to 3-7%
- Then finally settle on 4th
- Update forecast from 60% - 64%


Forecasting dangers
Under-reaction to news
Overreaction to news
- Need to weed out the irrelevant information
Find the middle passage between under- and overreaction

Belief Perseverance
When faced with new information a person will rationalize extremely to prevent their beliefs to be upset

Explaining
Never use a long word where a short one will do
Never use the passive when you can use the active
Break these rules quickly before you say something outright barbaric

Failure
Failure is an opportunity to:
- Learn
- Identify mistakes
- Spot new Alternatives
- Try again

Over confidence
As you become more experienced you can become more confident 
However this doesn’t mean you are also more accurate
You could be more confident without being accurate (Over confidence)
“I know the answer, I don’t need to think long and hard about this”
- To avoid this trap, need to carefully distinguish what you are confident about and not so.

Hindsight bias
Once we know the outcome of something, that knowledge skews our perception of what we thought we knew

Improving at forecasting
Practice, Practice, Practice
Good feedback on how your forecast is going
Willingness to say “Wow, I got that one wrong, I better think about why”
Leave notes (and detailed notes), that you can go back to

Rough Outline of a Super-forecaster
Cautious: nothing is certain
Humble: Reality is complex
Nondeterministic: what happens is not meant to be and does not have to happen
Open-minded: beliefs are to be researched, not protected
Reflective: introspective and self-critical
Pragmatic: not wedded to any idea or agenda
Analytical: able to step back from the tip of your nose perspective and consider other views
Dragonfly-eyed: value diverse and synthesize them into your own
Probabilistic: judge using many grades of maybe
Thoughtful Updaters: when facts chance, they change their minds
Intuitive Psychologists: aware of the value of checking for cognitive and emotional biases
Growth Mindset:  believe it is possible to get better
Grit: determined to keep at it however long it takes

Team dynamics
Teams that get along develop a number of “shared illusions” 
This interferes with critical thinking and reality testing
Team members need to question themselves and teammates 
- Inducing vigorous debate
Agreement is not always “good”
Disagreement is not always “bad”
If you do agree, this does not automatically mean you are right
- Always continue doubting

Constructive Confrontation
Precision Questioning
- Don’t take a personal shot (“You’re silly”): this only adds heat
- Don’t take an opposite view (“I don’t think so”): This only adds disagreement
- Don’t just use a question (“What do you mean?”): This is to vague
- Ask a “precision question”
o What do you mean by pastime?
o What evidence is there that soccer is declining?
- These questions reveal the thinking behind the conclusion so that it can be further probed and tested

“Imperfect decision made in time is better than a perfect decision made too late”

Team Management
Know the other side’s perspective as well as they know it
Precision Questioning: help others clarify their judgements 
Constructive Confrontation:  learning to disagree without being disagreeable

Leaders
Needs to figure the right move and execute it boldly

WYSIATI – What You See Is All There Is
Cognitive illusion
Prevents us from seeing any world beyond the one visible from the tip of our nose
- If an assumption feels 100% true, still need to check it!

Black Swan Investing
- Invest in high risk – high reward
- Diversify among a lot of investments
- Most will fail
- However if you can hit 1 or 2 that beat the odds and yield Google size fortune you are up.

Forecasting Accuracy Investing
Correctly deciding there is a 68% chance of something happening when the rest of the field thinks there is a 60% chance of it happening
Pays off more often
But in smaller increments
Fortunes amassed slower

How to overcome entrenched interests (Stubborn People or Opinionated)
Don’t storm the ramparts
Reason and relentless focus on the singular goal

Maybe Fallacy
Stick to the number and you risk being called out unfairly
Stay in vague terms and your safe

Number
Are tools – nothing more
Their quality can ranged from wretched to superb 

Improvement vs Perfection
Constant improvement is attainable
Perfection is not
Example: Credit scores are way off from being “perfect” but are a huge improvement on subjective ratings

Question Clustering
One tiny question doesn’t nail down the big question
But answering many tiny questions we can close in on the big question

Intellectual Humility
Knowing what you do know and what you don’t and respecting those who do.

Focus on questions where your investment is likely to pay off
Don’t waste time on questions where simple rules of thumb can get you close or stupid questions that are impossible.

Looking for errors
Don’t try and justify or excuse your failures, OWN THEM
Review your success as well, as you may have just lucked out on offsetting errors

Fundamental Attribution Error
We know that insomnia may be influencing our own behaviours and attribute our behaviours to that. 
But we don’t make the same allowance for others, instead assume that their behaviours reflects who they are



THE PREDICTIONEER’S GAME: Using the logic of brazen self-interest to see and share the future


GAME THEORY 101

Game Theory
Simple idea: that people do what they believe is in their best interest
By estimating carefully people’s wants and needs, anyone can make a reliable forecast of what each and every one of them will do.

Engineering the future
It is possible to:
- Anticipate actions
o When people will lie
o When people will tell the truth
- Predict the future
- Look for ways to change incentives. 
o Create leverage, where leverage doesn’t exist
Reflect on when people are likely to lie and when they are most likely to tell the truth
Find the right incentives so that people tell the truth, or believe our lies

Problem Solving
BAD
- knee jerk reactions
- gut feel
- personal opinionsH
- simple linear reasoning
- preferences
- ideology
GOOD
- logic
- evidence

Prediction with Game Theory
Learn how to:
- think strategically about other people problems the way you think about your own
- empathise with ow others think about the same problems
- think about how other people think about how you think about your problems and theirs
- view people:
o cold
o ruthless
o self-interested
- sustain beliefs on what is being observed
o but don’t hold onto them after they have been refuted

Rationality
- Is about choosing actions that are consistent with advancing personal interests.
- Don’t label people as irrational just because we don’t understand them

How others think
- The urge to feel good about ourselves and not to take the risk of offending others and not to bear the cost of their reaction
o Is sufficient to induce us to behave in a socially appropriate way
- People won’t cooperate or coordinate with each other unless it is in their individual interest

Rationale Self-Interest
- Mother Teresa + Suicide bomber
- Their actions are governed by self interest
- They may later find out they made a bad choice
o We must assess them on what they know, believe and value at the time of the actions

Agenda Control
- Determine the order of decision making
- Setting the right agendas could create a series of positive results

Language cues
- “it is fact that”= precedes an expression of opinion rather that a fact
- “it stands to reason”= the clause is being used to substitute for that hard work of showing that a conclusion follows logically from the assumptions

How to buy a car
- Control the agenda
- Research the car you want, along with any packages and bundles, colour and model
- Find every dealer that sells the car you want
- Ring each dealership
o Ask to be connected to a salesperson
o Tell them precisely  what you are doing
o “Hi my name is Ryan Hodder, I plan to buy the following car [List model and features] today at 5pm. I am calling all of the dealerships within a 50km radius of my home and am telling each of them what I am telling you. I will come in and buy the car today at 5pm, from the dealer who gives me he lowest price. I need to have the all-in price, including taxes, dealer prep (don’t need car washed and cleaned). I will make out the check to your dealership before I come and will not have another check with me.
o Tell the salesperson that you will tell the next dealer the price you’ve been quoted.
o Every call tell the salesperson that you will be repeating what I’ve is the lowest price offered to you so far.
- If the salesperson says
o  “I cannot sell you a car over the phone”
o Reply with” well I have purchased many cars this way, so maybe I can’t buy a car from you over the phone, but I know I can from others. So if you don’t not want to sell a car to me that is fine.
- If the salesperson says 
o “If I quote you a price, the next dealer will quote $50 less
o Reply with “That’s right, I’ll buy it from the other dealer. So “name of salesperson”, if you can quote e that fifty dollars less, this is your opportunity to do so.
- If the salesperson says 
o “Trust me, come in, we have the best prices in town”
o Reply with “Good, then you should be happy to quote the piece to me now because you are confident it tis the best price”
- Arrive at the lowest price dealership just before 5:00pm with check in hand.
- If there is any change to the terms, leave immediately and go to the second best offer and so forth



The Science of Predictioneering
- working out what:
o what others think
o what they think you think
o what you think they think
o what you think they think you think


Calculated Risk
- Part of being rationale
o Sometimes need to make decisions even though we are in the dark about the consequences


GAME THEORY 102

** The future shapes the past**


People’s interest
- People won’t cooperate or coordinate with each other unless it is in their individual interest

Need to ask all the “What If” questions
Work out how to get players to select strategies that are more beneficial for my client 
May not be able to change people’s beliefs but we can change the way their beliefs are harness
- Can’t change who board members will vote for a new CEO
- Can change the voting system however, to benefit m client
Rolling the dice (so you are not predictable) is a good way to alter how people perceive the situation

People always want 2 things when making a decision (different people will weigh these differently)
1. A decision that is as close to the decision they advocate for	
2. Glory – ego satisfaction that comes with recognition by others that they played an important role in putting a deal together

Try to exploit peoples ego to alter stances



DEFINING THE QUESTION

What is the problem?
- Adding up many smaller questions that add up to a solution
- Break the issue down:
o Smaller issues
o Smaller decisions for those issues
- Asking the right questions
- Isolate the key interests
o Avoid thinking conventionally
* the reasons behind the actions that seem to fit the puzzle
o Find the motives
Avoid
- Assess the problem by looking for the causes in its end result
- The beginning not the end is where the explanation lies

incentive’s
- Give people the right incentive’s and they will do right
- Give people the wrong incentive’s and they will do wrong
- Either way they are serving their own self interests


ENGINEERING THE FUTURE
Justice requires we distinguish between:
- Bad outcomes
- Bad intnetions
- Wilful ingnorance

It is best to judge people on what they reasonably could know and expect before they did things.
- Not based on what we know later, after situation has played o
- 
Game theory is there to prevent push come to shove

Game theory model is there to work out all the combinations of possible outcomes based on decision trees
- If I offer options A,B,C then does door D,E and F open and so on.
FAST-FORWARD THE PRESENT
Naysayers are too quick to equate what they see people do with what they think their core values are

By thinking hard about interests involved in a given problem, we have the opportunity to take the best available steps to ensure optimal outcomes.


HOW TO PREDICT THE UNPREDICTABLE
There are two ways to manoeuvre into a winning position
- Persuade others to adopt your point of view
- Adopt their point of view

We may have more potential to change someone’s mind then we may think

Don’t have to go to the winning position, can bring it to us
- Find the right arguments, opportunities, targets and coerce so the prospective winning position is close to where we want it


FUN WITH THE PAST
Governments elected by the people are accountable by the people
Unlike governments elected by the military, aristocracy, clergy or one political party who are then accountable to no one
One way to avoid bad results, you can simulate what is likely to happen


DARE TO BE EMBARRSSED
Any predictioneer worth his or her salt must be willing to risk the embarrassment that comes with being wrong

Need to figure out what questions to ask and how to frame them


   Thinking, Fast and Slow

KEY IDEAS
- Humans are always automatically searching for causality – pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world

- Overestimation of unlikely - Underestimation of likely

- Rationality is not defined by logical choices, instead by consistency

- We know far less about ourselves than we think we do

- WYSIATI: associative memory quickly and automatically constructs the best possible story from the information available

- Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it.

- Risk does not exist, independent of our minds and culture waiting to be measured.
o Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. 
o Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as “real risk”

- Ignoring and underweighting distributional information is the largest source of error in forecasting

- Extreme outcomes are much more likely to be observed in small samples

- People believe to be overly optimistic about their relative standing on any activity in which they do moderately well (Competition Neglect)

- How to treat others: When people are acting odd, we should first examine the possibility that they have a good reason to do what they do.

- People let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world

- Optimism in Academic Research, ability to exaggerate the importance my research

- Focus on things to make your life bit better every day, makes it better in the long run. 
o Don’t be afraid to buy these items
o Wi-Fi extenders, password protectors
o Bed, pillow, chair headphones


Intuition
- Intuition is nothing more, nothing less than recognition
- In the absence of valid cues, intuitive “hits” are due to either luck or lies

Human Mental Effort
- As you become skilled in a task, the effort decreases
- Switching from one task to another is effortful


Overconfidence
- People who only saw one-side of the evidence are more confident with their judgements that those who saw both sides.
- WYSIATI facilities overconfidence through constructing coherent story with cognitive ease

   Expert’s vs Algorithms
- Experts try to be clever and think outside the box (complex combinations of features in their predictions
- Simple combinations of  features are better
- The unrecognized limits of professional skill help explain why experts are often overconfident

Regression to the Mean
- Good performances are likely to be followed by bad performances and bad performances are likely to be followed by good performances
- The more extreme a score, the more regression is expected ( a very good score suggest a very lucky day)

   Regret
1. Is an emotion
2. The anticipation of the painful emotion associated with regret plays a part in many decisions
3. Stronger emotions occur when regret is expected after an action, compared to inaction

   Focusing Illusion
- Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it
- When asked about well being
o People will give to much weight to the climate (as it is WYSIATI)
- The focusing illusion can cause people to be wrong about their present state of well-being
- The focusing illusion causes a bias in favour of  goods and experiences that are initially exciting vs ones that will retain their attention and value in the long ter
SYSTEM 1
- System 1 makes us the world as more tidy, simple, predictable and coherent than it really is 
- Positives
o Fast
o Automatic
o No effort
o Good at simple tasks
o Intuitive
- Negatives
o Little understanding of statistics and logic
o Cannot be turned off
o Can’t deal with multiple different tasks at once
o Not prone to doubt (as it constructs stories which are coherent as possible)
o Assigns weights to difference characteristics of problems without you knowing
SYSTEM 2
- Positives
o Capable of reasoning
o Cautious
o Concentration
o Continuous monitoring of our own behaviour (keeps us polite when angry)
o Monitor and control thoughts and actions of System 1
o Capable of doubt
- Negatives
o Slow
o Requires attention
o Can be lazy
o Disrupted when attention is drawn away
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS
1. Stop and frown
2. Recognize you are in a bias minefield
3. If a decision requires little mental effort: this is a FLAG that a bias may be at play 
4. Base Rate     : 	always start with Base Rates
5. Outside view: 	what are all the perspectives
6. Framing         : 	what is the frame of the question (can it be reframed)
7. Anchor           : 	focus attention and search memory for arguments against the anchor
8. Availability   : 	is the problem at hand heavily dictated in the media (plane crash – feel unsafe)
9. Substitute     : 	based on how you are feeling
10. Multiple         :	perspectives as joint decisions
11. Thumb           : 	check not using a rule of thumb


BOFT SAMA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREDICTION / FORECASTING
- Research suggests: to maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas, especially in low-validity environments.

- Always start with base rates

Simple Weighted Algorithm
1. Select a few traits that are prerequisites, 6 is a good number
a. The traits need to be independent of one another
2. Set a scale (1-5), how you will score the scale
3. Don’t try and change selections, if there is another you like better – resist your wish

Statistical Intuitive Predictions
- Toby Greene DFS average is 95, when Whitfield is out he averages 120. Estimate his DFS score this upcoming week with Whitfield out 

1. Start with an estimate of average score = 95
2. Determine the DFS score that matches your impression of the evidence =115
3. Estimate the correlation between your evidence and GPA = 80%
4. If the correlation is 0.30, move 30% of the distance from average to matching GPA
a. Average 	            = 95
b. Matching impression  = 115
c. Correlation 	            = 80%
d. Final adjustment          = 95 + 0.80 * (115 – 95) = 111

LIFE IDEAS
- The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing? 
- Don’t evaluate life by its last moments or give no weight to duration in deciding what is more desirable

   What to do when lose something of money value
- Example: lose tickets to a show, should you buy more or give up?
- If you hadn’t bought the tickets yet and lost the CASH on the way to buying them, would you buy them. If yes then YES you should re buy the lost tickets.

Confidence
- Need to appear confident even when unsure 
- Generally considered a sign of weakness and vulnerability to appear unsure.
- Confidence is valued over uncertainty
- Experts who acknowledge the full extent of their ignorance may be expect to be replaced by more confident people (who are better able to gain the trust of clients)

   Optimistic
- Look to have a contribution of optimism in Academic Research as it will:
o Need an ability to exaggerate the importance of what he or she is doing
o Otherwise will wilt on the face of repeated multiple failures and rare successes (fate of most researches)
- Negative outlook:
o Don’t know when to stop persistence (likely to fail and will push through regardless)

Project planning/forecasting Fallacy
- When subjectively forecasting how long something will take:
o Most the time you will forecast the best  case scenario, instead of a realistic assessment 
o We failed to account for the unknown unknowns
- Instead use worst case or middle of worst case and best case

Expected Value
- Need to look at the long view of many decisions. 
o If you constantly pay a premium to avoid a small risk or a large loss = it will become costly
o Constant deviation from EV is costly in the long run
o Like continually overweighting probabilities of improbable outcomes
* I do this in poker, where I think hit a low % chance is higher than it is
* Need to see how taking this –EV chances will impact the long run
* Could be times where they are necessary or not
* Low money and might not get a chance to get back in the game

MONEY / INVESTING IDEAS
Money Tips
- Never buy extended warranties, that is the insurance agencies risk policy

Investing Tips
- Recent winning stocks tend to do better than recent losing stocks in the short term.
o Therefore, you should sell your losers and keep your winners

- Look at whole portfolio and sell the stock that is least likely to do well in the future (regardless if it is a winner or loser)

When to gamble
- If there is a small risk with a positive expected value (EV+)
- See small gambles throughout life as a bundle (win a few, lose a few)
- Gambles need to be independent of one another (so don’t all go bad together)
- Loss of gamble does not cause you to worry about your total wealth
- Don’t take gambles on long shots

Negotiation
- When negotiating, if the original anchor is ridiculously high or low, don’t counter with an equally ridiculous offer. Instead make a storm and walk out, making it clean to the opponent and yourself you won’t negotiate at such a price. 
o Otherwise you will create a gap in offers that won’t be able to be bridged

Endowment Event
- The Disadvantages of a change loom larger, than its advantages.
-  Inducing a bias that favours the status quo
o Experience Traders showed little Endowment Effect when trading
o Expereince Traders ask the question: “How much do I want that Mug”
*        Instead of asking: “What other things could I have instead”



WAYS OF THINKING
Think like a fox
- Complex thinker
- Don’t believe that one big ting drives history
- Recognize reality emerges from interactions of many different agents and forces
Don’t think like a hedgehog
- Have a theory about the world, and account for events using a coherent framework.
- Are impatient with  those who don’t see things their way
- Confident in their forecasts
- Reluctant to admit error


DEALING WITH OTHERS
Use Simple Language
- If you care about being thought creditable and intelligent, do not use complex language when simpler language will do

Communication
- If possible, recipients of your message want to stay away from anything that reminds them of  effort 
o Use this to simplify reports and bold main ideas
o When presenting a decision to people, FRAME it in a positive light / as a gain


Changing People’s Minds
- Facts that challenge basic assumptions – are thereby threaten peoples livelihoods and self-esteem – are simply not absorbed
- Even compelling causal statistics will not change long held beliefs
o However, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are a more effective tool of changing people stance as they require a causal story to link to

- When you want a decision, make the choice easy or unknowable to the person.
o Countries that have the highest amount of organ donors are the ones that have a opt out box on the form
* People find it easy to skip it, or don’t know about it 
* Instead of forcing people to have to find the box and tick it to go on the donor list


Meeting Ideas
- Remove one highly assertive member from a group and everyone else personalities change
- Open weight gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing other to line up behind them
   Use Premortem
- When a group decision is to be made
o Take 5-10 minutes to write how you believe the decision will play out
- This will overcome:
o Groupthink
o Unleashes imagination and creativity

First Impressions
- Halo effect: Use the emotion we feel towards someone to fill gap of evidence about them
o Joan is nice, (don’t know if she is generous), you like generous people. As Joan is nice she must also be generous.
- Increases the weight of first impressions, where further info is mostly wasted

Evaluating Expert Intuition
- Always consider whether there was adequate opportunity to learn the cues, even in a regular environment
