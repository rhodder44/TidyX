This is notes and code from **Patrick Ward** and **Ellis Hughes's** TidyX tutorials.

## **TIDYX 1**

-   Use case\_when instead of nested ifelse, easier for people to understand your logic

-   Convert characters to Factors when you want to specify the order for plotting

-   Stringr::word() - extract words from a sentance
